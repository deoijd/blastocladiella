blastocladiella
===============

This is a repository of all the scripts and output I have generated from sequencing the genome of Blastocladiella emersonii.


Eventually I will upload post-assembly files, to include:

Definitely
* Gene Predictions
* Protein/Amino Acids
* EST Filtering
* CEGMA Analyses
* GFF3 Data
* Annotation Data
* OrthoMCL Analysis

Maybe
* BLAST2GO Data

Unlikely
* Sequence Reads
 * Data is Too Big. I don't have £££ to pay github.
 * However, they may be available from out website http://gna-phylo.nhm.ac.uk)
* Assembly Data
 * All assembly data will be available from the website

Anything else will be available at http://gna-phylo.nhm.ac.uk/content/genome_projects - which will include: downloads of data, BLAST servers and a genome viewer etc
